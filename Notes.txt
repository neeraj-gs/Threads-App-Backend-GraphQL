GraphQL

Rest API
   Client ---->  Server
   User needs some resource does a GET request on an API Route, Server Gives the Data
   Problem:
   1.Only a Specific Part of data is required , but we need to fetch all if using REST API, Bandwidth reduces , unnecessary data is being transfered
   2.We need to fo a seperate call for more data from the first requiest , then server sends more unnecessary data
      Need to do 2 API Calls and more unnecessary data.


GraphQL
   Solution for the REST API Problems
      1.Client can specify the exact data required and not the entire respnse is sent.
      2. Instead of calling 2 API's we can have Nested queries , that solves the problem of repeated calling
